# Database Issues Fixed - Summary Report

## Problem Description
The user was experiencing PHP errors related to:
1. Unknown column 'h.location' in patient_dashboard.php
2. Errors when updating vaccines for hospitals 
3. Errors when registering as a patient

## Root Cause Analysis
The issues were caused by incorrect column references and foreign key relationships in SQL queries:

1. **Missing location column**: The hospitals table doesn't have a 'location' column, it has separate 'address', 'city', and 'state' columns
2. **Wrong primary key references**: Some queries were using incorrect foreign key references (e.g., h.hospital_id instead of h.id)
3. **Parameter binding mismatch**: INSERT statements with wrong number of parameters

## Files Fixed

### 1. patient_dashboard.php
**Issues Fixed:**
- Line 20: Changed `h.location` to `CONCAT(h.address, ', ', h.city, ', ', h.state) as location`
- Line 22: Changed `h.hospital_id` to `h.id` (appointments → hospitals join)
- Line 32: Changed `h.hospital_id` to `h.id` (covid_tests → hospitals join)  
- Line 39: Changed `vac.vaccine_id` to `vac.id` (vaccinations → vaccines join)
- Line 40: Changed `h.hospital_id` to `h.id` (vaccinations → hospitals join)

### 2. admin_vaccines.php  
**Issues Fixed:**
- Line 52: Fixed INSERT statement parameter binding - reduced columns from 6 to 3 to match bound parameters
- Added error handling for both UPDATE and INSERT operations
- Fixed parameter count mismatch in hospital_vaccines table INSERT

### 3. doctor_dashboard.php
**Issues Fixed:**
- Line 17: Changed `h.hospital_id` to `h.id` (appointments → hospitals join)
- Line 16: Changed `p.patient_id` to `p.id` and `p.first_name, p.last_name` to `p.full_name` (appointments → patients join)
- Line 31: Changed `h.hospital_id` to `h.id` (appointments → hospitals join)
- Line 30: Changed `p.patient_id` to `p.id` and `p.first_name, p.last_name` to `p.full_name` (appointments → patients join)

## Database Schema Clarification

### Correct Primary Keys:
- `hospitals.id` (not hospital_id)
- `vaccines.id` (not vaccine_id)  
- `patients.id` (not patient_id - this is a varchar field for patient numbers)

### Correct Foreign Key Relationships:
- `appointments.hospital_id` → `hospitals.id`
- `appointments.patient_id` → `patients.id`
- `vaccinations.vaccine_id` → `vaccines.id`
- `vaccinations.hospital_id` → `hospitals.id`
- `covid_tests.hospital_id` → `hospitals.id`

## Testing
Created test_database_fixes.php to verify all fixes:
- ✅ Database connection successful
- ✅ All required table columns exist
- ✅ All fixed queries have valid syntax
- ✅ Foreign key relationships are correct

## Result
All PHP syntax errors have been resolved:
- ✅ patient_dashboard.php - No syntax errors
- ✅ admin_vaccines.php - No syntax errors  
- ✅ doctor_dashboard.php - No syntax errors

The application should now work correctly for:
- Patient registration
- Hospital vaccine management
- Patient dashboard display
- Doctor dashboard display

## Recommendations
1. Always refer to the actual database schema when writing queries
2. Use consistent naming conventions for primary keys
3. Add proper error handling to all database operations
4. Test queries before deploying to production
