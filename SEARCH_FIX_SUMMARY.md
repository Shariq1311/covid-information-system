# 🎉 PUBLIC HOSPITAL SEARCH - ISSUE RESOLVED!

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**Issue**: The "Find Hospitals" button was routing to the register form instead of the public hospital search page.

**Root Cause**: The `public_hospital_search.php` page had database query issues that were causing infinite loops or errors, preventing the page from loading properly.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive error checking for database connections
- Added null/false checks for database results
- Wrapped database operations in try-catch blocks

### 2. **Fixed Database Query Issues**
- Proper error handling for the cities dropdown query
- Safe while loops with null checks
- Prevented infinite loops in result iteration

### 3. **Updated Navigation Links**
- Fixed the navigation bar in `app_header.php` to point to `public_hospital_search.php`
- Verified all homepage links point to the correct public search page

### 4. **Improved Code Structure**
- Separated query logic from display logic
- Added error messages for debugging
- Made the page more robust against database issues
